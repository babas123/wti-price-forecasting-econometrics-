# WTI Price Forecasting using Econometric and Multifactor Models

This project studies the dynamics and predictability of crude oil (WTI) prices
using econometric time-series models and multifactor approaches.

## Objectives
- Model and forecast WTI returns and volatility
- Compare ARMA and ARMA-GARCH specifications
- Analyze market drivers through a multifactor framework
- Extract latent risk factors using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Methodology
- Time-series modeling: ARMA, ARMA-GARCH
- Volatility modeling and conditional heteroskedasticity
- Factor construction from market indicators (OVX, Open Interest, Futures/Spot)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Out-of-sample validation and forecast evaluation (MSE)

## Tools
- Python (Google Colab)
- R
- Econometric and statistical testing (ADF, Jarque–Bera, Ljung–Box)

## Results
- GARCH models capture volatility clustering in WTI returns
- PCA reveals dominant market stress and speculative activity factors
- Multifactor models improve interpretability of price dynamics
